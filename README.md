# Transfer Statistics
Statistics for how courses transfer at CUNY

Tabulate the way courses transfer as blanket credits between CUNY institutions.

## Usage: `transfer_statistics.py [-b] [-c]`

Use the `-b` option to generate a database table of transfer rules where a course transfers only as
a blanket credit course

The `-c` option counts how often the courses identified by the `-b` option actually transferred, and
how they tranferred.
