# Transfer Statistics
Statistics for how courses transfer at CUNY

What courses are transferred, and how well do they transfer?

# Count Losses

How do colleges compare in their treatment of transfer students? In particular, how many credits do
students lose when they transfer?

As a first pass, count the number of rules where the receiving side consists only of blanket credit
or message courses.

The ultimate goal is to tell the average number of credits lost by students transferring from any
college to any other college within the CUNY system.
